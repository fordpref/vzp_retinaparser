nessus.py/exe readme
====================

Usage:

python nessus.py \<path-to-nessus-reports\> \<report output name\>.csv
nessus.exe \<path-to-nessus-reports\> \<report output name\>.csv


It will check the path and report name, then parse all the .nessus files in the directory you specify and output a .csv file.

It will ask you to evaluate each exploitable finding on whether it is a network facing exploit (ie, service, no user interaction) or whether it is a client side/local exploit (ie must already be on the system or have user go to website or open file).

the CSV file lists the CVEs from the nessus report file that have exploits available, what exploit frameworks have them, and what IPs are affected.  The output also includes a column for you to track whether you successfully exploited the finding or not.
